## Roadmap for Machine Learning and Deep Learning

There a LOT of resources to get you started on the path of Machine Learning. However you might find yourself one day in the Tutorial's Paradox where you end up signing in for a lot of MOOC's ,still get nowhere near to how actual ML works in the industry and research.Hence I created a curated list of all the resources which I personally read and viewed, the ones that I found the most useful, those which I believe would surely help you get a good grasp of all concepts and make you ready for starting your own projects in ML/DL.

### For Pure Freshies.

For those who don't even have a single bit of idea of what ML/DL is-

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HarshitShukla25/learn-ml-dl/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
